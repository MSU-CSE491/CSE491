# Additional class Video list

On the class [schedule](schedule.md) you will see class-by-class videos to watch for discussion.  Here are some additional videos that were informative.  They are divided into two groups: "C++ Basics", which review material that you should know coming into the course, and "Additional Content", which are useful for going more in-depth into topics that we don't have time to fully cover.

These resources will be expanded as the semester progresses.  Please make suggestions if you find a C++ video you think is valuable!

## C++ Basics

*[Back to Basics: Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN319NYEOcE)* (and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI6Lov1O9M)).  This is long (about 2 hours combined), but they review the details and nuances for how to work with templates in a lot of detail.  It was tempting to include these videos in the required material, but the combination of their length and the fact that most of the time is spent on material that was covered in previous courses led us to put it here instead.  That said, they are very well done and informative.

## Additional Content

*[What Programmers should Know about Memory Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYfd25Bdmws). Goes into more detail about memory allocation especially when working with multi-threaded programs.  Some of the speed improvements they are able to demonstrate are really impressive.
