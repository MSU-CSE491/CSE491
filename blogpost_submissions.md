# Blog Posts

## Drafts

You will submit your blog post draft and final product into the CSE 491 github repository.  For the drafts, here is the procedure you should go through:

**Step 1**: Create new branch off of the `cse_491_fall_2023` repository to put your blog post in.  Name the branch with your last name followed by "_blogpost".  So my branch would be called "`Ofria_blogpost`".

**Step 2**: In your new brach, create a sub-directory under "blogposts/" with your last name.  For example, I would create one called `blogposts/Ofria/`.

**Step 3**: Put your draft blog in this directory.  It should have DRAFT somewhere in the file name (and can be as simple as `DRAFT.html`).  I recommend that it be in HTML or MarkDown format since that will be the requirement for the final version, but other common formats (PDF, Word, etc.) are okay for the draft.  Add any supporting files that you need, such as images.

**Step 4**: Setup a pull request with the resulting files.  Make sure it includes all of the blog post files you just added, but do not include any files from outside of this new directory.  Mark it as "Merge: Ready".

Once this process is finished, we will be able to assign blog posts for review.

We expect the process for the final version of the blog posts to be very similar, but first we'll see how things go with the drafts...

## Reviews

Once all of the blog post drafts are turned in, you will be assigned three other blog posts to review.  Your reviews will submitted a Google form where the instructors will be able to see who wrote each review, but they will be kept anonymous from the other students.

You will receive an e-mail with the relevant information.
