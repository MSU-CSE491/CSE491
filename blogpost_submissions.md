# Blog Posts

## Drafts

You will submit your blog post draft and final product into the CSE 491 github repository.  For the drafts, here is the procedure you should go through:

**Step 1**: Create new branch off of the `cse_491_fall_2023` repository to put your blog post in.  Name the branch with your last name followed by "_blogpost".  So my branch would be called "`Ofria_blogpost`".

**Step 2**: In your new brach, create a sub-directory under "blogposts/" with your last name.  For example, I would create one called `blogposts/Ofria/`.

**Step 3**: Put your draft blog in this directory.  It should have DRAFT somewhere in the file name (and can be as simple as `DRAFT.html`).  I recommend that it be in HTML or MarkDown format since that will be the requirement for the final version, but other common formats (PDF, Word, etc.) are okay for the draft.  Add any supporting files that you need, such as images.

**Step 4**: Setup a pull request with the resulting files.  Make sure it includes all of the blog post files you just added, but do not include any files from outside of this new directory.  Mark it as "Merge: Ready".

Once this process is finished, we will be able to assign blog posts for review.

We expect the process for the final version of the blog posts to be very similar, but first we'll see how things go with the drafts...

## Reviews (NOT FINAL YET!)

Once all of the blog post drafts are turned in, you will be assigned three other blog posts to review, and likely turn them in view a Google form (we are still working on the details, but we want reviews to be anonymous to the receiver, but not to the instructors.)

When reviewing a blogpost, you will:
1. Rate it on four criteria (with a 1-5 rating, described below)
2. Write a short (3 to 4 sentence) summary of the blog post indicating its topic and some of its main points
3. Write a short review in which you justify those ratings along with any other comments that you may have
4. Provide a list of fixes that you think the author should make before they submit the final version of the post

### Scoring criteria

**Clarity** (How good was the technical writing?)<br>
**5** - Eloquently written, understandable technical descriptions,  and enjoyable to read<br>
**4** - Clearly written and relatively easy to understand<br>
**3** - Mostly well written, but a few confusing portions (described below)<br>
**2** - Confusing in many places, needs editing throughout<br>
**1** - Unreadable and almost impossible to understand.<br>

**Thoroughness** (How fully covered was the topic?)<br>
**5** - The post was carefully crafted to effectively cover the topic in depth, given the constraints of a blog post.<br>
**4** - The post hit all of the most important components for its topic.<br>
**3** - The post was solid, although some relevant pieces were unclear or missing.<br>
**2** - The post had some interesting pieces, but major components were missing.<br>
**1** - The post had superficial coverage at best, barely hitting on any of the important topics.<br>

**Technical Depth** (How deep of an understanding of C++ did the author demonstrate?)<br>
**5** - C++ references were numerous, detailed, and well chosen<br>
**4** - References to C++ were appropriate and included where needed, with only minor gaps<br>
**3** - C++ was discussed frequently and usually appropriately, but not always with sufficient depth or in quite the right places<br>
**2** - While some references C++ were good, there were too few, they were often misplaced, or else they showed a poor understanding of the language<br>
**1** - Barely any links to the C++ language or only superficial mentions<br>

**Overall Quality**<br>
**5** - Excellent quality, top marks!<br>
**4** - Good quality, solidly passing<br>
**3** - Reasonable quality, sufficient for passing<br>
**2** - Poor quality, possibly failing<br>
**1** - Problematic quality, definitely failing<br>

<!--
How would you rate the quality of your own review?
**5** - I feel like I am an expert in these topics and am fully confident in my review<br>
**4** - I am comfortable with these topics and believe my review is solid<br>
**3** - I am not completely comfortable in some of these topics, but still feel comfortable in my evaluation<br>
**2** - I did not fully understand the topics in this blog post, but feel my evaluation is still useful, if not perfect<br>
**1** - I felt like I was not able to produce a sufficiently informed review.<br>
