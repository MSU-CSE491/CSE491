# Project Overview

The largest chunk of the work for this course will be developing your semester project.  It will be worth a total of 45 points, plus an additional 12 points associated with your weekly updates.

Your final grade on the project will be based on three factors:

## 1. Functionality (20 points)

At the beginning of the semester we will develop a set of ambitious goals for each project.  You will earn points based on how well you meet these goals. In some circumstances these goals may be adjusted based on revised information and any changes that we may need to introduce to your project.  The instructors will be in regular communication about your progress and you will be heavily involved in any such changes.

## 2. Code Quality (20 points)

While the ultimate functionality of your code is clearly important, being able to write code that is reliable, reusable and easy to understand by other programmers is also a high level goal for this course.  Code quality will be judged based on:
+ **_Code Style_**: Have you chosen a style that is informative?  Are you consistent in your style?
+ **_Code Accessibility_**: Is your code easy for others to read and understand based on your maintenance of documentation, code comments, and a clean layout with short clear functions?
+ **_Code Modularity_**: Have you built useful functions and classes that are organized with a meaningful file and directory structure? 
+ **_Code Reliability_** Do you have thorough unit test coverage with effective use of in-code asserts and/or other error checking, and do you avoid undefined behaviors?

You will be getting regular in-class advice and feedback on these topics throughout the semester.


## 3. Individual Contributions (5 points)

While the larger portion of your project grade will be based on the overall group project, it is important that each group member provides a meaningful contribution.  Based in part on ratings by your teammates (and audited by the instructors using progress reports and git logs, if needed) you will receive a qualification for how effective of a contributor you were to the group project.

+ **_Proficient Contributor_**: You have met all of the expectations and delivered your portion of the project.  You worked diligently on the project throughout the semester and were a reliable member of the team.  You will receive the full five points for this section.

+ **_Inconsistent Contributor_**: While this person has participated and contributed to the project, they have done so inconsistently and haven't fully met the group's expectations. They might have missed some tasks or not been substantially involved in the discussions or implementation.  No points will be giving for individual contributions, but the student will still receive other project points.

+ **_Minimal Contributor_**: This denotes a member who has not actively participated in the project. Their contribution is negligible or missing, and their lack of involvement has hampered the group's overall progress.  Not only will no points be given out for individual contributions, but the overall project grade will be substantially reduced.

Additionally, we have two other categories that will be given out sparingly.

+ **_Resilient Contributor_**: You have showcased exceptional efforts, going above and beyond base expectations to enure that your group turns in a working project. You will receive the full five points from contributions AND may recoup some points back (typically 5) from the previous to grading factors, replacing lost points in other areas of the project.  This rating will typically be given to a student who put forth significant extra effort to make up for another group member's failure to meet expectations.

+ **_Exemplary Contributor+**: You went substantially beyond project requirements, turning in code that is impressive on all levels.  You will receive the full 45 points on the project, but this qualification also recognizes the incredible effort that you put forth.
