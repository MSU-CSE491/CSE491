### Required Technology
Students are expected to bring a laptop running a modern operating system (Windows, MacOS or Linux) to each class session.  This laptop must be capable of running a modern C++ compiler and have access to the web.

### Description
Students will develop large C++ projects and gain expertise with the language. Topics include modern features of C++, effective use of the standard library, and developing custom libraries, with links to other areas of computer science. Emphasis will be placed on writing code that is secure, reliable code, efficient, and generic, including good memory management practices, avoiding undefined behavior, automating through testing, and up-to-date documentation. 

### Pre-requisites
Understanding of C++ basics (as taught in CSE 232 and CSE 335), completion of all 300-level CSE requirements and at least two other 400-level CSE courses.

### Teaching Style
This course will be taught using a “flipped classroom” methodology. Students will be expected to watch provided videos before each class session.  Sessions will briefly review these topics, but focus on discussion of concepts and live implementation, debugging, or code reviews, as well as quizzes, small group discussions, and student presentations of their progress. 

## Grading
Grades will be based on:

| **Project** | 55 points |
| **Quizzes** | 28 points (7 quizzes at 4 points each) |
| **Blog** Entries | 12 points |
| **Participation Questions** | 5 points |
| **TOTAL** | 100 points |

You will need 90 of the 100 possible points to guarantee a 4.0, 85 points for 3.5, 80 points for 3.0, 75 points for 2.5, 70 points for 2.0, 65 points for 1.5, and 60 points for 1.0.

### Project
You will be placed in a group to work on a semester-long project.  You may earn up to 55 points this way, based on both consistent progress and the quality of the final product.  Your final project grade will be based on three main factors: Functionality (Meeting the project goals), Code Quality (Consistent style, documentation, function modularity, file layout, test coverage, etc.), and Individual Contributions (Teammate ratings, weekly project reports, and git logs).

### Quizzes
There will be eight quizzes that you need to pass by the end of the semester.  The first quiz will be one “C++ Pre-Requisites” and will not be worth points, but must be passed before you can take any of the other quizzes. The remaining seven quizzes will each be worth 4% of your final grade.  Quizzes will have a high threshold for passing, but will have multiple versions so you will be able to take each quiz at least twice with only the best performance counting.

### Blog Entries
You will need to write a blog entry over the course of the semester and act as a reviewer on three others.  For the entry you are writing, points will be allocated to the outline (1 point), the initial draft (1 point), and the final document (4 points). For the three reviews, you will receive one point for reviewing each draft (3 points total) and another point for reviewing each final entry (another 3 points total).  Overall the blog entries will be worth a total of 12 points.

### Participation Questions
You will be expected to watch videos before each class session that cover much of the material for that session. During class we will discuss the material, do live coding, take quizzes, etc. In order to ensure that you watch the videos, we will ask you a multiple-choice question about them on at least 8 occasions. These questions will be easy if you watched the video, but impossible to answer confidently otherwise (e.g., “What was the example problem used throughout the video?”).  Each correct answer will earn you 1 point to a maximum of 5 points (so you can get 3 wrong and still get a perfect score).

**A note about participation**: If you engage in conversation, you provide us with another source of information as to how well you are learning the material, and how much effort you are putting into the course. Let's have an active class! Class participation will never harm your grade; always ask any questions you may have about the material.

## Academic Dishonesty
Unlike most CSE classes, this course will encourage you to discuss any course material with each other and even make extensive use of outside sources including AI systems.  The main issues that you need to be careful about are that you provide appropriate credit (i.e., cite your sources and do not claim someone else's work as your own) and that you take any in-class quizzes or participation questions on your own without getting help from anyone else.  While it is okay to use previously written code or AI-generated code (with citations in either case), your project group is responsible for generating the bulk of new code that you use.

Because a primary goal of this course is to teach professionalism, any academic dishonesty will be grounds for receiving a failing grade for the semester. Specific examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to):
+ Copying another student’s quiz answers.
+ Using code or text not written by yourself without attributing credit.
+ Paying someone else to write project code for you.
+ Providing false information to an instructor about matters related to the course.
+ Facilitating another student in any of these activities.

## General Note
The goal of this class is for you to learn how to effectively design and implement algorithms. If anything is coming in your way of that goal, please talk with us about it. We plan to keep the class flexible to the learning styles that seem to work best for the students, so feedback is always appreciated.
