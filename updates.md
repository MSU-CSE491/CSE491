# Weekly updates

Each Friday before midnight (starting in week 2) students will be expect to turn in a weekly progress reports. 
These reports are helpful for several reasons:
+ They allow the instructors to maintain a good understanding of how the projects are progressing.
+ They help the students focus on where they are in their project and self-identify if they are falling behind schedule.
+ If there is disagreement at the end of the semester with how much work was done by each group member, they provide a real-time record of contributions.

Each report must contain at least four sections:

**What did you work on this past week?** List the key efforts that you made on the project over the past week, highlighting any accomplishments.

**What do you plan to work on next week?** List your goals for the next week, including any design goals, development goals, collaborative plans, or auxiliary tasks (contacting people, researching a topic, etc).

**Are you facing any challenges with the project?** Are you having any difficulties with the project, especially ones that the instructors may be able to provide guidance on?

**How is the overall project going for the entire group?**  Indicate how you feel your group as a whole is progressing on the project goals.  Indicate any problems or concerns you may have, as well as shout outs to any group members performing beyond expectations.

Some reports might have extra specific questions that you will be told at least 48 hours ahead of time.  In general such questions will focus on additional details about specific aspects of the project, though they may be about the broader class.

Reports are worth 1 point each and will be graded on a pass/fail basis (honest attempts will be given a "pass" as long as problems are corrected in future reports).  Overall you will be expected to turn in 14 of these reports, but a maximum of 12 points will count toward your final grade.
