# Quizzes

There will be a total of five quizzes that you must pass by the end of the semester to earn all points.

## Topics

The first quiz will focus on **C++ Pre-Requisites**; it will not be worth any points, but must be passed in order for a student to be allowed to take subsequent quizzes.  It will be composed entirely of C++ material drawn from CSE 232 or CSE 335 exams.

The next four quizzes will be based on the first four units from this semester, each worth up to 6 points.  Specifically, quiz 2 will be **C++ Fundamentals**, quiz 3 will be **Reliable C++ Code**, quiz 4 will be **Generic C++ Code** and quiz 5 will be **Efficient C++ Code**.  The advanced topics unit will not have an associated quiz.

## Grading

Quizzes will generally be 10 questions long and structured using a "mastery model".  We expect you to learn all of the material on each quiz, but you may take the quizzes multiple times until you have mastered it.

For the pre-requisite quiz, we require a 8/10 to pass and continue on to the other quizzes.  For each of the others, a 9/10 will be need to earn all six points.  Each additional question you get wrong will deduct two points from your total. 

<table>
<tr><th> Correct Responses <th>Points Earned
<tr><td> 10 (of 10) <td>6 points (of 6)
<tr><td> 9 <td>6
<tr><td> 8 <td>4
<tr><td> 7 <td>2
<tr><td> 6 or fewer <td>none
</table>

## Schedule

Quizzes will be released by the end of the unit covering the material (the pre-requisite quiz will be available starting on the first week of the semester).

We will provide at least one class session most weeks, typically during the Wednesday session, where we will allow students to take a quizzes.  Overall students will have at least 12 occasions to take the quizzes, giving many opportunities for re-takes if needed.
