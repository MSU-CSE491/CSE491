# Quizzes

There will be a total of five quizzes that you must pass by the end of the semester to earn all points.

## Topics

The first quiz will focus on **C++ Pre-Requisites**; it will not be worth any points, but must be passed in order for a student to be allowed to take subsequent quizzes.  It will be composed entirely of C++ material drawn from CSE 232 or CSE 335 exams.

The next four quizzes will be based on the first four units from this semester, each worth up to 6 points.  Specifically, quiz 2 will be **C++ Fundamentals**, quiz 3 will be **Reliable C++ Code**, quiz 4 will be **Generic C++ Code** and quiz 5 will be **Efficient C++ Code**.  The advanced topics unit will not have an associated quiz.

## Grading

Quizzes will generally be 10 questions long and structured using a "mastery model".  We expect you to learn all of the material on each quiz, but you may take the quizzes multiple times until you have mastered it.

For the pre-requisite quiz, we require a 8/10 to pass and continue on to the other quizzes.  For each of the others, a 9/10 will be need to earn all six points.  Each additional question you get wrong will deduct two points from your total.

| 10 (of 10) | 6 points (of 6) |
